// These constants won't change.  They're used to give names
// to the pins used:
const int analogInPin = A0;  // Analog input pin that the potentiometer is attached to
int sensorValue = 0;        // value read from the pot

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the analog in value:
  sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);

  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  // wait 200 milliseconds before the next loop
  // for the analog-to-digital converter to settle
  // after the last reading:
  delay(200);
}
